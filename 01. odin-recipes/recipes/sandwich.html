        Grilled cheese sandwiches are delicious with all sorts of sides and
        entrees, but they pair particularly well with tomato-based soups and
        stews. Try one of these top-rated recipes
      </h3>
      <p>
        This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use
        sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese
        with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is
        sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will
        quickly fall apart.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 slices white bread</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one
          side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot
          skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one
          side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking
          until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread,
          butter, and slice of cheese.
